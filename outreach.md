To aid in increasing scientific literacy and bettering scientific communication, I started the Outreach Initiative for the Student Chapter of the American Chemical Society (ACS) at the University of Michigan. This group trains graduate student volunteers in communication to take polymers-based lessons to K-12 classrooms across Southeast Michigan, and has reached over 50 classrooms and nearly 3000 students since its inception. Our pedagogy and best practices were documented in an [article in the Journal of Chemical Education][1].

In 2017, I created [Research Education and Activities for Classroom Teachers (REACT)][2], a one-day workshop for Michigan teachers focused on providing access and exposure to University of Michigan research across all fields, held in both 2017 and 2018 attended by a combined total of 72 teachers from across Michigan. The day included [research talks][3] by doctoral researchers, laboratory tours, and activity demonstrations by student outreach groups. This workshop has continued since my departure from Michigan, and was the subject of the peer-reviewed article <a href="https://peer.asee.org/35030">{{"Bringing Science Education and Research together to REACT"}}</a>. <br><br><br>
